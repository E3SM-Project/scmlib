WARNING: This diagnostics package current works but is still in development and considered to be in beta testing mode.  Feel free to use it, however there is currently limited documentation; especially with regards on how to add LES and observational datasets.  More documentation and guidance will be provided.  

Currently, there should be sufficient guidance for you to use the diagnostics package for model vs model analsysis.

The user should only need to modify and run the following file:
- iop_diagnostics_driver.py

The diagnostics package will run on the e3sm unified environment.
